#### Hi, I'm Bailey 👋

I'm a Full Stack Junior Developer with five years of previous experience working in high growth startups.

#### The story so far

After graduating from Oxford University in 2008 with a degree in English Literature, I realised I had little to no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I worked as an agent for sign language interpreters, then as a receptionist at a high-end hairdressers, then as a credit controller at an IT services firm...

Finally, in 2011, I found something I loved. Tech. I heard about the newly christened 'Silicon Roundabout' and started hanging out every night at any meetup I could find. I ate a lot of free pizza 🍕

After a lot of conversations with a lot of interesting people, I met a startup founder who was willing to take a chance and employ me. I joined [Funding Options](https://www.fundingoptions.com/) pre-launch in 2012. I've since worked at another two early stage Fintech startups, [MarketInvoice](https://www.marketinvoice.com/) and [Monzo](https://monzo.com/), helping to put in place marketing strategies and teams.

#### Why coding?

After my last role came to an end at the beginning of 2017, I decided to take the opportunity both to travel and to learn new, exciting things. After all, what are savings for if not for spending? 💸

I've wanted to learn to code for years. I've loved every opportunity I've had to tinker, from building my first website with Microsoft FrontPage aged 11, to fancifying my teenage Myspace page with inline CSS, to building HTML email templates as part of my work as a marketer.

Luckily, I knew a good place to learn more: [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Over three months I learned Ruby and Javascript in a TDD-focused environment, pair programming every day (want to see how far I've come? check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/baileytalks?tab=repositories)).

The course is over, but I want to keep coding! So now I'm looking for my first job as a developer 🤞

## What else can I do?

#### I'm a self-motivated learner 📚

I'm big on learning new things and generally pick up new things quickly.

In my previous work as a marketer, I often needed to learn new techniques from scratch in order to succeed. For example, when I saw an opportunity to gain new leads from search engine marketing I was up-and-running with Google Adwords within a couple of days.

On top of recently completing Makers Academy, I am currently participating in a co-designed [learning marathon](https://www.enrolyourself.com/), researching lifelong learning and Edtech. I'm also a regular at public lectures at the LSE as well as meetups like [Codebar](http://codebar.io/).

#### I'm a proactive contributor 🙋🏻

Like many people, I have things I'm passionate about. The potential of technology to positively impact on lives; seeing more gender diversity in the tech industry; being part of an open, collaborative culture at work.

Unlike a lot of people, though, I tend to get stuck in whenever I see an opportunity to make a difference.

For example, a couple of years ago, when working in Fintech, I became frustrated by the fusty and over-commercialised meetups I kept getting invited to across London. So often these were events organised for legacy bankers, by legacy bankers, where actually what my friends and I were interested in were the innovations taking place in startups. So I set up my own [Fintech meetup](http://meetup.com/youhadonefintechjob) and organised events with more relevant speakers. The meetup now has 1,250 members.

I'm always excited to improve workplace culture, too. I organised a whole [company offsite at MarketInvoice called 'MIcon'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9XPuitbjEk), where over 60 employees listened to talks from the CEO of TransferWise and the founder of Indeed. In the evening, the team enjoyed cocktails, street food and a DJ. A few months later I organised an after-work code club for the company.

> "Bailey is an absolute pleasure to work with. She is quick thinking and quick-witted, independent and more than happy to get stuck in and help out with anything."
>
>– Rosa Glover, ex-Techhub, where I used to volunteer, helping with meetups


#### I love to collaborate 👫👫

I owe every success to the great teams I've worked in.

Having worked in several high-pressure environments, I've had to quickly pick up and implement good practices for managing projects and organising teams. I love a good kanban board, and am usually the member of the team who's coordinating standups and writing up notes.

I have also managed teams in two startups, MarketInvoice and Monzo. At MarketInvoice I went from being the sole marketer at the company to managing six people in less than two years – a steep learning curve! I loved working with like-minded smart, motivated people.

> "Bailey was very much the heart of our marketing team, driving the team forward with her passion for the product."
>
>– Paul Spicer, worked with me at MarketInvoice, now Head of Marketing at Hopster
