## Skills

#### Self-motivated learner

I constantly strive to improve my skills and generally pick up new things quickly. Most recently I learned Ruby in just a couple of weeks using online tutorials, prior to starting Makers Academy.

In my previous work as a marketer, I often needed to learn new techniques from scratch in order to succeed. For example, when our team recognised an opportunity to gain new leads from search engine marketing, I learned how to set up and optimise a Google Adwords campaign alone over a couple of days by researching online.

I enjoy learning and am proactive in finding new opportunities to push myself. On top of recently completing Makers Academy, I am also currently participating in a co-designed [learning marathon](https://www.enrolyourself.com/), researching lifelong learning and Edtech. I also love public lectures at the LSE, going to meetups such as Codebar, and am also often caught with my head stuck in a book about economics or behavioural science!

#### Proactive contributor

Like many people, I have things I'm passionate about. I'm passionate about the potential of technology to positively impact on lives. I'm passionate about seeing more gender diversity in the tech industry. I'm passionate about being part of an open, collaborative culture at work.

Unlike a lot of people, though, I tend to get stuck in whenever I see an opportunity to make a difference.

For instance, a couple of years ago, when working in Fintech, I became frustrated by the fusty and over-commercialised meetups I kept getting invited to across London. So often these were events organised for legacy bankers, by legacy bankers, where actually what my friends and I were interested in were the innovations taking place in startups. So I set up my own [Fintech meetup](http://meetup.com/youhadonefintechjob) and organised events with interesting speakers. The meetup now has 1,250 members.

I've also been proactive in previous workplaces, helping to improve culture. One example is that I organised a whole [company offsite at MarketInvoice called 'MIcon'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9XPuitbjEk), where over 60 employees listened to talks from the CEO of TransferWise and the founder of Indeed. In the evening, the team enjoyed a party with cocktails, street food and a DJ. A few months later I organised an after-work code club for the company.

> "Bailey is an absolute pleasure to work with. She is quick thinking and quick-witted, independent and more than happy to get stuck in and help out with anything."

> Rosa Glover, ex-Techhub (where I used to volunteer help with events)

#### Loves to collaborate

I owe every success to the great teams I've worked in.

Having worked in several high-pressure environments, I've had to quickly pick up good practices for managing projects and organising teams. I love a good kanban board, and am usually the member of the team who's coordinating standups and writing up notes.

I have also managed teams in two startups, MarketInvoice and Monzo. At MarketInvoice I went from being the sole marketer at the company to managing six people in less than two years – a steep learning curve! I loved hiring smart, motivated people and working with them as a team.

> "Bailey was very much the heart of our marketing team, driving the team forward with her passion for the product."

> Paul Spicer, worked with me at MarketInvoice
